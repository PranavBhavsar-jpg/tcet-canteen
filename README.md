# TCET Canteen – Food Ordering Website🍽️

TCET Canteen is a frontend-based food ordering web application designed to
digitize the traditional college canteen system. This project allows users
to browse food items, view prices, and add items to a cart through an
interactive and responsive user interface.

The project focuses on frontend development while simulating backend
operations using JavaScript. All cart management and order handling are
performed using JavaScript arrays and functions, making it ideal for
academic and beginner-level full stack understanding.
